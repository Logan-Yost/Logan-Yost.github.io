    <p>
    My hero worked hard for all of his accomplishments. He put in the time on the field, in the classroom, and in the community to make himself and the people around him the best that they can be. </p>
    <p>
    My hero is Peyton Manning. Throughout his NFL career, Manning had:</p>
<ul>
    <li>539 TDs</li>
    <li>71,940 yards</li>
    <li>2 Super Bowl Wins</li>
    <li>5 MVP awards</li>
</ul>
<p>
Peyton is, in my opinion, the greatest athlete in the past 20 years, and also one of the best of all time.</p>
